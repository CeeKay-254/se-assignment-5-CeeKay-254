Assignment 2
Installation of VS Code:

To download and install Visual Studio Code on a Windows 11 operating system, follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Visual Studio Code website (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click on the “Download” button.
2. On the download page, select the option for Windows and click “Download”.
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer file. There are no special prerequisites needed to install VS Code on Windows 11.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

First-time Setup:

After installing VS Code, here are some important initial configurations and settings to adjust for an optimal coding environment:

1. **Theme and Appearance**: Go to “File” > “Preferences” > “Color Theme” and select a theme that suits your preferences. You can also customize the font size, editor zoom, and other display settings.
2. **Workspace Settings**: Create a new workspace or open an existing project. Go to “File” > “Preferences” > “Settings” to configure workspace-specific settings such as file encoding, line endings, and indentation.
3. **Extensions**: Browse the VS Code Marketplace and install essential extensions for your development needs, such as language-specific tools, code formatting, and debugging utilities. Some popular extensions include ESLint, Prettier, and Live Server.
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with the available keyboard shortcuts by going to “File” > “Preferences” > “Keyboard Shortcuts”. You can also customize the shortcuts to your liking.

User Interface Overview:

The main components of the VS Code user interface are:

1. **Activity Bar**: Located on the left side, the Activity Bar provides quick access to various VS Code features and views, such as the Explorer, Search, Source Control, and Extensions.
2. **Side Bar**: The Side Bar, usually on the left, displays the currently active view, such as the File Explorer, Search, or Extensions.
3. **Editor Group**: The central area is the Editor Group, where you can open, edit, and view your code files.
4. **Status Bar**: The Status Bar at the bottom provides information about the current file, programming language, and other helpful status indicators.

Command Palette:

The Command Palette in VS Code is a powerful tool that allows you to access a wide range of commands and actions. To open the Command Palette, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS). From the Palette, you can perform tasks such as opening files, running commands, changing settings, and managing extensions.

Extensions in VS Code:

Extensions play a crucial role in enhancing the functionality of VS Code. To find, install, and manage extensions, follow these steps:

1. Open the Extensions view by clicking the square icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
2. Search for and install extensions from the Marketplace, such as language-specific tools, code linters, and debuggers.
3. Once installed, you can manage the extensions by enabling, disabling, or updating them as needed.

Integrated Terminal:

To open the integrated terminal in VS Code, press `Ctrl+\`` (or `Ctrl+J` on macOS). The integrated terminal allows you to run shell commands, execute scripts, and perform other terminal-based tasks directly within the VS Code environment. The advantages of using the integrated terminal include seamless integration with your development workflow and the ability to quickly switch between the terminal and your code editor.

File and Folder Management:

In VS Code, you can create, open, and manage files and folders using the following methods:

1. **File Explorer**: The File Explorer in the Side Bar allows you to navigate your file system, create new files and folders, and open them in the Editor Group.
2. **Quick Open**: Press `Ctrl+P` to quickly open a file by typing its name or path.
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use shortcuts like `Ctrl+N` to create a new file, `Ctrl+O` to open a file, and `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O` to open a folder.

Settings and Preferences:

To access and customize the settings and preferences in VS Code:

1. Go to “File” > “Preferences” > “Settings” to open the Settings editor.
2. Search for and modify settings such as theme, font size, and keybindings.
3. You can also edit the `settings.json` file directly to apply more advanced customizations.

Debugging in VS Code:

To set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code:

1. Install the appropriate debug extension for your programming language.
2. Create a new debug configuration by pressing `F5` or going to the Debug view and clicking “Create a launch.json file”.
3. Select the appropriate debug configuration template for your project.
4. Modify the launch.json file as needed to match your project’s structure and debugging requirements.
5. Set breakpoints in your code and start the debugger by pressing `F5` or clicking the green “Start Debugging” button.

Using Source Control:

To integrate Git with VS Code for version control:

1. Install the Git extension if it’s not already enabled.
2. Open a folder or project that is already a Git repository.
3. Access the Source Control view in the Activity Bar.
4. Initialize a new Git repository by clicking the “Initialize Repository” button.
5. Stage, commit, and push changes to your remote Git repository using the provided Source Control UI.
